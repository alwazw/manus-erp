# ERP System Development Task

This task involves debugging and enhancing a full-stack ERP application, focusing on resolving Docker deployment issues, frontend-backend connectivity, and UI/UX improvements.

## Phase 1: Initial Docker and Backend Debugging (Completed)
- [X] Update `docker-compose.yml` to include the Next.js frontend application.
- [X] Create a `Dockerfile` for the frontend service.
- [X] Resolve port conflicts for the frontend service (port 3002).
- [X] Fix `SyntaxError` in backend `app.py` logging configuration.
- [X] Push backend fixes to GitHub and guide user to pull and restart.

## Phase 2: Frontend Connectivity and Build Issues (In Progress)
- [X] Analyze console logs for `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` and `Cross-Origin Request Blocked` errors.
- [X] Attempt to fix CORS by updating backend `app.py` CORS configuration.
- [X] Implement Next.js API proxy for frontend-backend integration (all pages updated, `next.config.js` created).
- [X] Resolve all frontend build errors (TypeScript/ESLint issues, unused variables, etc.) after implementing Next.js proxy.
- [X] Fix all TypeScript type errors for `errorData` (unknown type) in `products/page.tsx`, `purchases/page.tsx`, and `sales/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Validate that the frontend build is successful and the Next.js proxy allows API calls to the backend without CORS or "Failed to fetch" errors.

## Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements and Final Fixes (Pending)
- [ ] Integrate the new company logo (`vv_logo.jpg`) provided by the user into the frontend.
- [ ] Create and implement a favicon from the new logo.
- [ ] Update UI elements based on user feedback (e.g., line alignments, more elegant/3D icons, distinct icons for Purchases and Reports).
- [ ] Incorporate the company name "Visionvation" into the UI as appropriate.
- [ ] Address the client-side error on the Reports page (`DollarSign is not defined`).

## Phase 4: Final Validation and Handover (Pending)
- [ ] Thoroughly test all application functionalities after all fixes and enhancements.
- [ ] Report the successful resolution and discuss any next steps with the user.
- [ ] Provide final instructions for running and accessing the application.
